firefox currently supports wide number stand alone e-mail applications (including thunderbird client), e-mail link clicked firefox.
best knowledge still support web based e-mail clients g-mail fashion.
idea one prefers use web based e-mail account, option configure firefox log web based e-mail account open compose new message window.
understand may require colaboration popular web based e-mail services gmail aim mail, think would worth benifit.
reproducible: always
something like webmailcompose extension?
enhancement requests like marked dups bug 11459, think that's wrong.
far tell, bug 11459 combination design flaw specific seamonkey tangentially related enhancement request also applies firefox, nothing happening there.
sad mailto: links work webmail users, especially since webmail popular.
webmail services help give users programs alter system mailto: behavior (e.g. unofficial \"g-mailto\" official \"gmail notifier\"), firefox users download webmailcompose extension, think would better option firefox itself.
going block this, would good generically feeds well, may wait gecko 1.9
using mozilla/5.0 (windows; u; windows nt 5.1; en-us; rv:1.9.1) gecko/20090615
firefox/3.5
fixed?
indeed.
