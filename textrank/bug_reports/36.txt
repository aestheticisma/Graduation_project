version: (using kde 4.1.2)
installed from: compiled sources
amarok version 1.94
moving large amount files collection, amarok2 opens file dialog every single file moves.
reproduce:
make directory would like music collection stored.
go amarok2 set new collection area included.
then, right-click local collection, select organise select new destination files.
even core 2 duo 2 gb ram could handle 16,000 file dialogs, crashed whole system hard, requiring reboot.
please either:
1) move files sequentially,
2) display file dialog?
