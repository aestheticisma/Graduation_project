amarok2-svn like new contextview , found new bottom bar managing applets annoying , covers parts applets sometimes , like lyrics one , miss part it.
could handy appear desappear onmouseover.
thanks
real solution make cover applets, make appear/disappear mouse over.
dont understand point, dan... make cover applets?
thats problem solve :)
toolbar like panel kde, gets area draw (a strut window manager terms).
applets consider space toolbar takes play in, rather end top it.
well move window desktop down, panel cover it.
still understand...
right, new windows placed desktop get placed panel, maximizing windows put panel either.
need explicitely place window panel, considder bug possible (but that's debate about).]
panel obfuscate applets default.
fully agree dan here, also fully admit slightest clue implement technically :)
really think wrote makes lot sense, feasible.
created attachment (id=32462) [details]
amarok-svn toolbar overlap
dan meaning this.. screen better words sometimes :-)
know looks like, 've staring day. btw, screenshot outdated :)
still see else guys plan visualize it.
want border applet area, instead hitting panel directly, ends border?
mean, applets *will* logically location panel---all applets user fit screen time---so else show it?
applet end toolbar begins.
applets larger viewable area, there's applet it, lower applet get smaller sizehint, resize necessary active applet (and therefore one screen)
basically, applet continue screen, end panel.
disagree :) describing different use-case cv general, distinctly different original idea developed.
fact, think another bug we've already discussion (with mark), come irc.
anyway, something fixed, rather change needs discussed people like e.g. leinir.
regardless this, problem \"applets falling end screen\" mitigated able resize applets.
can't tell screenshot attached bug intended.
way see final line two lyrics applet.
major bug.
bug shown fact cannot yet resize applets, also set default sizes sanely.
reporting bug non-completed feature ;)
infact wish! ;-)
course :) thought point feature yet completed - polish that's gone ù…ately could seem like indication feature completion, would seem prudent course inform ùhat case :)
think dependent able resize freely all...
time, sizegrip resizing ends bottom right corner, such, would inaccessable reguardless whether free sizing not.
bug applet can't made smaller, part applet completely inaccesible.
fully agree dan aswell.
understand confusion doesnt matter applet resizable not.
quote dan:
\"the applet end toolbar begins.
applets larger viewable area, there's applet it, lower applet get smaller sizehint, resize necessary active applet (and therefore one screen)\"
that's expected behaviour used playlist aswell.
track items dont overlap lower toolbar, they?
*** bug 174221 marked duplicate bug. ***
fixed 2.1.1, done locally.

leo confirm that?
could close this....
