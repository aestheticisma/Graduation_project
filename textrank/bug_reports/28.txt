since kopete multimessenger idea metacontacts etc think neccessary display network contact online (because matter), makes even sense people several different accounts irc nicks keeping track quite clutter contact list, would simply like option turn displaying tiny icq/irc/etc icons right (or wherever choose be) display name, hope done time soon, thanks kopete great app!
i'd like option exactly opposite ! :-)
fact, contact list organised [kopetestatusicon][contactname][protocolicon].
well, i'd like way tell kopete display [protocolicon][contactname].
fact, best way would allow css customisation contact list, message windows :-)
