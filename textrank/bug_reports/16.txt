according havoc:
need struct fields widget, please file bug report, never required use widget.
accordingly, took look places latest pygtk wrappers directly access widget data attributes provide needed functionality.
found 43 examples, identified table below.
(of course, may pygtk use expose.)
data attributes accessed directly provide python programmer.
assume means would also accessed directly c programmer.

thanks, helpful.
bogus already accessor functions, believe:
gtk_bin child
gtk_check_menu_item active
gtk_text_buffer tag_table
also, deprecated widgets.
many probably functions for.
adding api keyword, putting future milestone.
considering accessor functions, might also want consider raising api bit higher level.
example, combo widget probably value-changed signal direct access underlying entry list widgets deprecated higher level functions written combo widget get necessary functionality.
since gtklist widget already deprecated, stuff going break applications someday anyway.
kidding breakability combo box: already pretty much broken gtk-- (c++ binding), use different implementation (deprecated) list, basically makes impossible access list data.
change gtk+ api allow access list items function would make whole lot usable.
suggestion:
make list combo glist.
would also make working combo easier...
sure there's good way handling arbitary widgets associated text without creating sort listitem
(deprecated) replacement...
ongoing gseal work finally taking care this.
