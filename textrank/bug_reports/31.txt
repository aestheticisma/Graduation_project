&gt;we also improve current search/replace dialog.
minimal improvements like able resize dialog.
completely redesign dialog e.g. provide firefox-like search unless contributed patch.
things look at:
-- ctrl-backspace work text editor widgets (try fields search dialog text fields plugin.xml editor)
-- support seaching multiline text alow replace multiline text
-- improve usability search dialog.
namely, replace direction radio buttons additional buttons like \"find previous\", \"replace previous\".
would make getting back accidentally skipped search match much easier.
&gt;-- ctrl-backspace work text editor widgets (try fields search dialog text fields plugin.xml editor)
please file separate bug reports, e.g. control pde editor - thanks.
&gt;-- ctrl-backspace work text editor widgets (try fields search
problem jdt ui started map text editor's editing commands onto text, combo widgets using textfieldnavigationhandler.
would possible push parts textfieldnavigationhandler platform text provide dialogs around editor think general issue since users also expect navigation commands work
wizards, ctrl+h search pages etc.
can't adopted jface depend text editor plug-ins.
solve this, jface adopt/define editing commands used along widgets would provide navigation handler(s).
file bug report platform ui describe problematic.
please add cc-list. thanks.

&gt; extensible hyperlink support
would prefer extensive hyperlink support much lower (ideally styledtext widget not, jface level).
ui forms would like port formtext styledtext.
styledtext added many key features 3.2 time frame hyperlink support last one need order port.

[return]: add cr/lf current text box
[ctrl-return]: send return key parent dialog (similiar executing default action).
