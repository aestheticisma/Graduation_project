group title taken account window-eyes 4.5.
group title pronouced radio buttons controls.
not, bug since blid users cannont know group content dealing about.
interesting.
window-eyes jaws read group title group single child obvious name, example, text list combo box.
neither screen reader read group title groups set radio buttons check boxes, say.
(or, assume, surrounding something obvious label read instead, like button, child control takes focus).
several dialogs - notably, search find/replace dialogs, groups radio/checkbox children.
screen readers read group titles dialogs.
bring attention screen reader developers.
now, extreme, sort-of useable work-around window-eyes tell read every control newly-opened dialog.
with:
global -&gt; verbosity -&gt; activated... entire window dialog
ccing frank lin.
2 examples eclipse dialogs group title read:
1) click flashlight (search) tool main toolbar.
click tabs notebook.
pages \"scope\" group.
pages \"search for\" group \"limit to\" group.
none titles read jaws.
2) open editor file, select edit -&gt; find/replace... (or type ctrl+f) get find/replace dialog.
\"direction\", \"scope\", \"options\" group titles never read.
think best thing would read one radio checkbox controls gets focus (i.e. dialog activated, user tabs new group clicks control another group.
today, frank lin tested jaws 5.0, 5.1 6.0 beta, found dialogue flashlight find/replace edit group titles spoken correctly.

investigation, determined problem happens windows xp javaw.exe.manifest installed jre/bin (this tells winxp use winxp common controls - version 6.0 - instead win2k common
controls - version 5.x).
problem solved jaws.
window class object reassigned internally jaws.
fix reflected jaws version 6.0 due shortly.
verified works jaws 6.0.
thank-you, frank!
