problem:
method folderdescription#createexistentresourcefromhandle(iresource,iprogressmonitor) checks folder already exists returns immediately so.
cases folderdescription members existing moment, members created.
use case:
assume want create folder file folder use two operations this.
know necessary use two operations configuration complex example code.
ifolder folder = ... // must exist
createfolderoperation op1 = new createfolderoperation(folder,...);
ifile file = folder.getfile(...); // must exist
createfileoperation op1 = new createfileoperation(file,...);
op1.execute(...);
op2.execute(...);
execution op2 create file stated createexistentresourcefromhandle returns immediately parent folder file created op1.
imho createexistentresourcefromhandle must check members folderdescription created.
checked code ganymede release problem exist too.
reason cannot execute op1 creating op2?
basic problem workspace file structure changed since first created operation, change described operation longer valid.
&gt;is reason cannot execute op1 creating op2?
not.
meantime found workaround code think inconvenient someone must know op2 created execution op1.
api gave hint so!
maybe build folderdescription could delayed execution op2.
think cases ops nothing common e.g. created executed different plug-ins.
i'll mark one m4.
think needs happen javadoc better describes lifecycle operations, isvalid() method tightened operation becomes invalid workspace changes longer match recorded state.
intention classes stay synch workspace changes happen independently shared, sequential workspace history.
moving target m6 shipped.
fixed head &gt;20090416.
order understand better ramifications might actually fixing bug vs. better documenting limitations usage, started implementing trial fix problem reported.
pretty straightforward rearrange code create child resources (the file) even parent exists since operation created.
however, problems occur later try undo operation.
since operation \"remembered\" folder exist first created, undo create file operation tries also delete folder.
means truly fix bug, we'd change operations resource descriptions constantly updated deal changes occurred.
still believe better document clearly intentions api are.
i've updated javadoc abstractresourcesoperation, createfileoperation, createfolderoperation.
addition, created stricter validity check createfileoperation operation return invalid status portions resource tree already exist.
created workspaceoperationstest.test250125() simulate condition.
createfileoperation valid createfolderoperation run, time file operation knows invalid.
&gt; addition, created stricter validity check createfileoperation operation return invalid status portions resource tree already exist.
meant say is...
created stricter validity check createfileoperation operation return invalid status portions resource tree *that exist operation created* already exist time execution.
expected/allowed containment tree already exists op executed, long also existed op created.
verified via automated test cases run build.
also verified source inspection
