using nightly builds project neon, kdebase version 20080617+svn821478-0neon1
seem problems zoom view.
layout activities properly.
steps reproduce:
1. zoom out.
2. add activity.
newly added activity shown, top left corner screen.
3. zoom in.
4. zoom out.
activities shown, order added, whitespace around them.
another activity added, happens again, zoom twice get 3 activities show.
opensuse, kde 4.1 beta 2.
i'm using nvidia binary drivers btw, nvidia geforce 6600 gt.
found \"offset\" activity overview changes double click second activity.
probably happens adding activity.
point, possible anymore use drag&drop move first activity.
zooming out, selecting first, zooming fixes it.
yeah, regression crept ago, bugging lot.
we've actually got multiple bugs report, it'd nice separate (but leave minute).
1) adding/switching activity makes view jump suddenly another place (it's trying make sure activity visible, stupid it)
2) dragging view around see activities longer works (regression! worked woc)
actually, dragging around view work *except right adding activity*.
know functionality filed report.
adding activity makes view jump another place, also placement new activity seems arbitrary.
bug = add activity focuses view new activity zoom level changes
well then, let's make title bit clearer
think add activity option (and zoom out) removed 4.1 final.
bug quite big, plus there's clear way delete activity.
also,performance zoomed slow hell.
report issues already reported thought others pretty obvious.
get wrong, great idea, current status makes confusing, useless buggy :s
performace fine me.
using nvidia?
already people making use multiple activities, we're going take away them.
it'd really really nice bug could fixed somehow, though.
&gt; bug quite big
huge crashes machine, loses dat, etc, right?
molehill, stop making mountain.
&gt; current status makes confusing, useless buggy
use it.
gotten many reports people like using day day work.
suppose desire see set problems hidden overrides productivity?
we'd taken approach 4.0 we'd even behind.
