according javadoc platform.getresourcestring(bundle,string), method deprecated one use nls class bundlefinder.find().
able find nls class find bundlefinder class.
javadoc correct?
hint find bundlefinder class would help.
nls class seem provide functionality platform.getresourcestring does, assuming bundlefinder would job need.
please provide information find bundlefinder improve javadoc.
think replacement functionality ever implemented.
pascal, added bunch comments like platform ver. 1.92.
current plans act (and actions done last 2 years) think need remove comments - make rather confusing javadoc.
21 \"xxx\" comments removed javadoc acted upon.
adding m7 milestone remind remove comments.
