i've noticed frequently trigger rotate gesture accidentally, usually scrolling.
gestures improved since original landing (when triggering wrong gesture really easy), articular gesture still problematic.
basic reasoning highly disruptive switched another tab expecting it.
happens, know happened notice entirely different page, that's randomly left right (1 tabs) page thought on.
i'm think rotate gesture switching tabs nearly useful, discoverable, good fit gestures are.
so, given problem, disable 3.5.
[i'd also open tweaking make much harder trigger accidentally, dunno that's possible.]
see also bug 461376.
play around browser.gesture.twist.* about:config temporary workaround.
justin, odd thing find trigger zoom frequently tab rotate ... far far frequently.
also find firefox, osx.
wonder much us vs. odd timings causing misreads trackpad osx.
think i've never accidentally switched tab rotate gesture.
actually i'd probably decrease default threshold tab switching.
i've triggered zoom repeatedly too;
usually fix right away quick browse though content-prefs.sqlite shows ~20 sites zoom settings know set.
that's probably zoom subtle effect (for 1 step, relative distraction accidental tab switch causes).
playing different browser.gesture.twist settings, i've found twisting tabs often resulted triggering zoom.
probably twist awkward gesture make, especially quarter-turn...
around point, fingers want spread join, ends read pinch.
guess that's part i'm really fond gesture, would soon turn off.
i'll try running threshold 40, suspect there's unavoidable conflict making easy use purpose, yet hard invoke accidentally.
i've using swipe left/right change tabs cmd-left/right go back/forward, rotate change tabs well accidentally triggered it.
maybe rotating technique ;)
i'm right handed position index finger 7oclock ring finger 1oclock.
rotate right end 8/2oclocks.
first time came contact tab switching via gesture accidentally.
sure happened, appeared another tab figure why.
tab-switching gesture right obvious feels unexpected hit it.
mardak: way written code, disabling gesture pref-flip, right?
blocking decision mulling, probably take though.
yup, able unset default value twist prefs:
-pref(\"browser.gesture.twist.right\", \"browser:nexttab\");
-pref(\"browser.gesture.twist.left\", \"browser:prevtab\");
would setting value empty-string (\"\") work, something similar?
would nice leave prefs visible want use them.
since implemented win7 multitouch screens please sure disable windows.

&gt; since implemented win7 multitouch screens please sure disable windows.
fine me; though i'd bit wary windows users hit problem multitouch trackpads...
rob says hardware/drivers exist today, common problem.
keep eye problems issues touchscreens, andt rob demoing touchscreen would appear harder trigger.
maybe windows 7 better discriminating gestures.
otoh big deal disable globally.
safari use it, rob confirmed ie use windows 7.
bug rotate, want consider pinching too?
take out, we'll swipe up/down jump top/bottom swipe left/right back/forward default.

&gt; bug rotate, want consider pinching too?
maybe; certainly noted people accidentally hitting gesture too.
though think separate decision: rotate unnatural gesture switching tabs (nothing else uses way), high penalty accidentally triggering.
pinching natural gesture page zoom (and widely used/known), low penalty accidentally triggering.
think people would consider bug claimed support multitouch, pinch anything.
so, i'd strongly lean towards removing rotate. pinchy would've wanted way.

pinch definitely left win7.
tracking turned get nice zoom in/zoom effect.
also nearly impossible trigger without definitive pinch two fingers screen.
want consider disabling pinch, please file separate bug, conflate.
fwiw, i'm nearly keen disabling one, fairly-to-surely likely wontfix bug.
go ahead ... try ;)

v1
anything os x twisting.
alternatively, people tried upping threshold twist?
would make less likely accidentally trigger.
noticed something interesting os x's gesture detection.
- use 2 hands (1 finger each) place one top one bottom, moving top finger registers normal mouse move moving bottom finger registered twist.
suppose heuristic assume top finger used scrolling.
- also, fingers close edge, treat rotate. still move pointer edge.
get patch reviewed - think want remove rotate gesture windows osx.

give empty commands twist gestures, nothing, still show prefs about:config.
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/3329a3997d7b
verified fixed trunk 1.9.1 builds os x windows like:
mozilla/5.0 (macintosh; u; intel mac os x 10.5; en-us; rv:1.9.2a1pre) gecko/20090525 minefield/3.6a1pre id:20090525031110

back this, would chance getting...
browser.gesture.swipe.left.shift added set browser:prevtab

browser.gesture.swipe.right.shift added set browser:nexttab
made change, must admit finding firefox almost 'alien' use multi-touch machines!
