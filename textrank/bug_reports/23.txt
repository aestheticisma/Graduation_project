bug duplicate bug 362539.
reason:
1) although underlying cause may same, symptoms two bugs different.
2) since description attached bug 362539 include symptoms bug, properly include reported problem.
3) users search problem, bug closed, probably find description.
find bug 362539 since include symptoms top level.
hence find circumvention.
4) therefore, please re-open bug report.
5) please attempt amend description bug 362539.
please leave decision, well closure, one bugzilla 'monitors'
know whether appropriate and, so, cleanly, without obscuring user access information.
right ...
