using alt+tab switching applications works fine kde4 post rc1 version, try use alt+shift+tab shortcut keyboard respond anymore know get back.
however mouse still working properlly, logout mouse log back keyboard also works.
hit bug well.
unfortunately can't re-trigger moment.
alt-shift-tab anything here, keyboard still accessible.
really serious problem.
seems hit alt+shift+tab directly always get problem.
hit alt+tab alt+shift+tab release get well, make sure always hit alt+tab last thing.
kde 3, alt+shift+tab one possible shortcuts used switching keyboard layouts (keyboard layout kcm -&gt; xkb options -&gt; layout switching tree item).
even though box ticked, still persists changing layout shortcut.
perhaps, shortcut sent place causing crash due bitrot?
editing kglobalaccelsrc change shortcut help, killing kxkb help thus think kxkb causing problem.
*** bug 153495 marked duplicate bug. ***
confirm.
reboot.
note mouse behaving shift key pressed: extending selection clicking left button.
problem kglobalaccel, release grab shortcut set triggered.
case alt+shift+tab, shortcut actually send x11 alt+shift+backtab.
re-assigning.

thanks, hotfix fixed problem, however past krushday someone mentioned similar issue pressing alt+printscr still present me.
know related original issue, close bug.
could be, i'll check later today.
iirc alt+print screen snapshot function right?
easily check wether issue following:
open $home/.kde4/share/config/kglobalshortcutsrc find action there.
open shortcut dialog application change one shortcuts.
asked pressing new keyboard combination press alt+print keys check wether label shortcut button rc-file.
differ problem means need different fix problem, hotfix comitted.
kglobalshortcutsrc assigned alt+print kwin, also alt+shift+tab kwin.
one application like konqueror konsole assing new shortcurt alt+print get's changed automatically alt+shift+print, can't assign another alt+print shortcut.
however assign alt+shift+tab shortcut, besides still showing shortcut settings work, also appear kglobalshortcutsrc apart old one already existing assigned kwin.
also know setup 'kcmshell4 keys' can't modify shortcut, fact, show any, another bug.
ok far see problem, namely keys alt+print produce x11 keysequence expected.
particular alt+shift+tab creates qt key sequence alt+shift+backtab seemingly alt+print creates alt+shift+print qt key sequence.
indeed problem.
regarding keys kcm: thats \"expected\", kcm properly ported.
i've already posted patch minimal port kde-core list.
one get comitted next monday, unless get objections.
discovered another similar shortcut ctrl+printscrn suffer problem works expected.
knowledge, alt+shift+print alt+print triggered bug.
