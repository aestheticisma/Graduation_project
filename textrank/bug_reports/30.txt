would usefull add \"swap\" button quickly change aspect ratio portrait landscape.
needed extracting portrait landscape photo.
since sign going happen 2.4, bumping target future.
*** bug 355694 marked duplicate bug. ***
i'm going reset 2.4 expect implement soon.
easier much faster user interface: swap portrait landscape based mouse movement.
already move mouse make selection.
likely something approximately right ratio.
that's closer portrait, portrait get used, otherwise landscape get used.
another way explain this:
user makes selection, select landscape mode horizontal mouse movement greater vertical mouse movement, otherwise select portrait mode.
that's one less confusing button occupying screen space.
that's one less button press.
work faster, less hand/finger/wrist pain.
albert, completely misunderstood this.
point able flip aspect ratio created rectangle selection.
really? found alberts comment spot on.
basically would eliminate need kind button, since x 1/x would work equivalently gui.
see much point able flip aspect *after* creation rectangle.
placement resulting rectangle would need readjusting anyways (what fixed point rectangle flipping?) sounds much natural able switch orientation on-the-fly creating rectangle.
i'm reporter wish.
sven right, meant would usefull swap option creation rectangle selection.
\"by hand\" often case :
i've landscape photo contains interesting flower example.
want print photo proportions original, portrait format, adapted flower.
1. first \"take shhot aspect ratio\" selecting original landscape photo.
2. freeze aspect ratio (with appropriate checkbox)
3. shrink rectangle permit rotated 90â°
4. \"rotate\" taking calculator, calculating 1/[aspect ratio], putting hand
5. i've perfect portrait zone wich adapt freely flower; i'm happy :)
know adding toolbutton problem, really think i'm one sort cropping photo.
thanks interest !

agree albert's idea makes sense.
gimp assume landscape portrait orientation automatically depending whether rectangular area swept user wider higher.
might problematic aspect ratio nearly, exactly square, even user could control proper aspect exaggerating motion larger two directions.
swap button maintained 2.3.12, register initial point used sweep rectangular area use anchor rather upper-left corner used.
likely first point selected user desired point upper-left corner unless happens started.
stated elsewhere, would also great aspect ratio automatically set initial aspect image loaded.
might provide \"lock\" button force current aspect ratio retained upon subsequent loading images times someone wants crop series pictures proportions.
maybe current fix button could toggle switched \"lock\" (lock aspect ratio - current behavior) \"set\" (automatically set aspect ratio new image locks it) \"auto\"(the set behavior combined behavior suggested albert) \"none\".
said this, appreciate toggle button all. thanks.
making depend user's mouse action discoverable.
way user find swap aspect ratio.
way.
might make sense determine initial aspect ratio way.
still needs button swap it.
comment #7 exactly usage scenario this.
implemented trunk seems work reasonably well.
closing fixed.
