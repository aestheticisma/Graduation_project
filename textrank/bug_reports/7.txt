about:mozilla page rc2 right-aligned, ltr directionality instead rtl.
result, dot end sentence right side instead left, parentheses around \"10th edition\" line right side.
also think quote source left side.
perhaps page take css intl.css, localisers override classes add class set direction.
actually would like add yet another entry intl.css fix aboutmozilla.xhtml.
pike, think it?
behavior also affect internal pages.
* about:plugins
pages get rtl:
* about:crashes
* about:robots - open issues. see bug 427029
pages translated, about:cache, about:credits about:buildconfig stay ltr.
about:mozilla page used file language pack, allowing localizer control look.
moving language pack created problem.
file dom/chrome/global.dtd control direction control entity locale.dir.
can, actually, support rtl using something like &lt;body dir=&locale.dir;&gt;.

tested hebrew locale.
please let know prefer 'body{direction:&locale.dir;}' instead current '&lt;body dir=\"&locale.dir;\"&gt;'.
w3c prefers markup css:

\"because directionality integral part document structure, markup used set directionality document chunk information, identify places text unicode bidirectional algorithm alone insufficient achieve desired directionality.\"

actually i'm sure using css.
idea something like 'body{direction:&locale.dir;;}' valid.
me, trunk solution separate entity pages, work around bugs like bug 427029.
localize page ship, would set dir ltr rtl.
that's solution 1.9 branch, though, re-use locale.dir global.dtd.
imho. gavin, think?

sounds fine me, guess...
really need worry \"rtl locale that's falling back en-us\" though?
ideally could take patch worry localizers update various different attributes based
localization state, rely completing localization work make look decent.
words, bug 427029 edge case given nature about:robots \"optional\" status localizers?
seems like could live looking perfect rtl locales localized rather adding complexity.
well, depends disciplined folks are.
could make call per page, like case robots page, might make sense open window translating it, neterror pages probably less.
could even get extreme per div ;-).
i'm adding another screenshot bug 427029.
axel, gavin - welcome comment issue right there.
