please describe problem:
going file-&gt;acquire-&gt;screenshot windows port development build gimp 2.3.11, firstly two different entries \"screen shot\" \"screenshot\" secondly, functionality grab portion screen broken.
option \"select region grab\" user chooses \"screen shot.\"
however, option exists dialogue box appears user selects :screenshot.\"
however, functionality work, even selecting long delay period.
instead, whole screen captured time.
expecting mouse cursor onscreen change \"crosshairs\" something similar allow select region required.
steps reproduce:
1. launch gimp 2.3.11 development windows windows 2000 platform.
2. got file-&gt;acquire-&gt;screenshot. (note two different entries \"screen shot\" \"screenshot\".)
3. tick \"select region grab.\"
4. set delay.
5. click \"grab.\"
actual results:
whole screen captured time.
expected results:
ability select portion screen would available, probably via mouse click-and-drag functionality.
happen every time?
yes.
information:
(i presume two entries screenshots submenu order test old new code, way noted case issue.)

sven,
bug report alert case know broken.
obviously aware incomplete.
perhaps disable prevent questions users.
programmer cannot implement functionality.
trying part reporting issues you.
complained short volunteers are.
case, perhaps good idea drop support win32 consolidate making sure *nix implementation good possible.
supporting win32 probably draining resources away.
iirc tor working this.
apf, using development version.
course incomplete even broken features there.
user, using stable release.
tor said impossible implement look feel x11 screenshot plug-in windows platform.
