please describe problem:
try export reports contain graphs gnucash creates empty html file.
also clear export html files.
first time ran export triped save .jpg created html file named foo.jpg
steps reproduce:
1. gnucash go reports create report contains graph
2. report window click export
3. save export \"foo.html\"
actual results:
empty html file saved
expected results:
html file nice graph
happen every time?
yes
information:
yes, that's true -- current graphing code, uses graphical library \"guppi\" dead project, produce on-screen diagrams *and* print postscript, cannot export diagrams pictures embedded html-file.
words, print diagrams postscript export html.
going change gnome2 port completed, need switch different graphical library anything related changed.
see http://gnomesupport.org/wiki/index.php/gnucashportingstatus porting status.
definitely keep reminder.
able coax anything giving us png; gog supports svg export, too.
looks like gtkhtml support saving &lt;object /&gt; data.
sucks ass.

there's change this.
wonder recent gtkhtml supports getting &lt;object /&gt;s, recent gog makes trivial create png.
case, hesitate so, i've raised severity normal -- minor part component (reports, export, graphs) work.
(fwiw, fred, going get fixed faster normal enhancement.)
confirm using gnucash 2.0.5 ubuntu 7.04, feisty fawn...and confirm frustrating....
2.2.8, still needed feature... frustration also confirmed.
gtkhtml provides callback encounters &lt;object&gt; tag, gnc-html calls gog create image gdkpixbuf embed web page.
webkit port, &lt;object&gt; callback.
therefore, gnc-html-webkit pre-parses html string, finds &lt;object&gt; tag, calls gog parameter values &lt;object&gt; create gdkpixbuf, converts pixels png/base64 embeds html &lt;img&gt; original
&lt;object&gt; was.
result graph displays webkit.
addition, gnc-html-webkit saves html passed webkit handles export writing html file.
fix targetted 2.4.
also convert gnc-html-gtkhtml use two features (convert graph embedded &lt;img&gt; export rather
getting gtkhtml it) can't build 2.4 webkit.
turns gtkhtml (at least version ubuntu 9.04) support inline images.
therefore, possible using webkit.
gnucash-1.8.x series longer developed.
may keep enhancement request reminder, though.
