images rescaled gimp always defaults linear scaling.
sometimes want bunch images cubic scaling.
would handy scale dialog remembered last setting always present one.
default interpolation routine choosen preferences dialog.
thought would easier remembered last setting, way newbie search trough preferences, handy want scale set images different way normally
jaap right.
know preferences setting saw bug report.
applies general options user set without going preferences dialog: remember last setting, need entry preferences dialog.
would need entry whether save last used setting, users want this.
michael, agree extra entry whether save setting yes no.
would clutter interface even more.
still need entry preferences need extra entry scale dialog whether save last used setting.
always remembering last setting conceptually far easiest new users.
furthermore think really problem change setting (in case also click save setting).
times change setting.
agree convenient able set default value place used (e.g., image-&gt;scale dialog) instead open preferences find corresponding option.
useful familiar options available preferences.
however, disagree proposal last setting automatically become default: set default cubic (i might change lanczos soon) expect used time.
time time, scale bitmap image without interpolation.
want become new default give bad results scale another image two days later.
way change default scale dialog (which probably good idea), require explicit action user.
could button like \"set default\" checkbox \"remember setting\" next \"interpolation type\" dropdown list.
&gt;&gt;jaap right. know preferences setting saw bug report.
lol, too.
think suggestion \"set defaults\" button good all-round solution satisfies camps.
see bug request deal scaling units (percent/pixel) way.
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=357424
think \"set defaults\" button would clutter ui.
change remember settings across dialog invocations.
closing fixed.
(please reopen strongly disagree, please without non-ugly suggestion gui)

remember settings scale resize dialogs images layers.
fixes bug #164995, bug #316392, bug #357424.
* app/dialogs/scale-dialog.h: removed gimpscalecallback typedef.
* app/dialogs/dialogs-types.h: added here.
* app/dialogs/image-scale-dialog.[ch]: made imagescaledialog struct private, return gtkwidget* image_scale_dialog_new() use gimpscalecallback public api.
* app/actions/actions-types.h: #include \"dialogs/dialogs-types.h\"
* app/actions/image-commands.c: changed according image scale dialog changes. remember scale dialog's unit (if \"percent\") interpolation type across dialog invocations.
also remember resize dialog's unit (if \"percent\").
* app/actions/layers-commands.c: remember scale resize dialog stuff image-commands.c
