open new image,
create layer much bigger image, different aspect ratio.
draw something drawable (using colors)
make selection selecting parts drawing
use channel mixer.
selection looks wrong plugin, plugin even crash.
due fact selection mask taken gimp_drawable_get_thumbnail_data () preview code.
layer image different size, streched differently.
clearly bad, *should* doing?
preview follow shape selection bounds, image, drawable?
big image, use crop tool right, bottom right bottom, click resize.
active picture little layer.
using tool preview give one pixel (or less ;) ) preview instead good one.
compute intersection layer active picture could solution...
far see, two reasonable options, either require substantial amount fixing aspect preview code plugins use it.
(1) show entire drawable aspect preview, mask changes using current selection.
(2) show part drawable lying within selection bounds.
clear better.
bumping 2.4 since likely get fixed 2.2
bumping future since likely get fixed 2.4.
setting back 2.4 milestone since crash should, possible, looked 2.4 release.
fixing might make api changes necessary.
need look soon possible.
would help lot someone could attach example xcf file bug report shows problem.

bug156905.xcf.bz2 - layer bigger image
following assertion failed using channel mixer layer.
(channel_mixer:6701): libgimpwidgets-critical **: gimp_preview_area_mask: assertion `mask != null' failed
channel mixer use gimpzoompreview (not gimpaspectpreview)?
seems like gimpzoompreview gimpaspectpreview problems steps reporter's comment taken.
one nasty track down.
example image dimensions 377*233, selection starts x=125, y=97 extends lower right corner image.
preview code calls gimp_drawable_get_sub_thumbnail selection mask following coordinates:
src_x: 117, src_y: 89, src_w: 268, src_h: 152
unsurprisingly fails, since src_x+src_w bigger selection mask width.
source coordinates seem wrong originate gimp_zoom_preview_get_source_area(), yet tracked down.

gimpzoompreview handle layer offsets
patch fix gimpzoompreview handle layers offsets selections.
area displayed preview intersection layer selection.
objections, could commit patch.
gimpaspectpreview selection mask applied thumbnail whole drawable (selection intersect partialy drawable area).
please commit this.
make sense patch 2 [details].4 point.
please trunk only.
