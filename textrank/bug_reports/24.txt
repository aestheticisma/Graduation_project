folders pane thunderbird lists e-mail accounts local folders allow select several folders once.
instance able click james folder select it, shift-click john folder select without deselecting james folder, drag *both* friends folder.
currently one time.
reproducible: always
steps reproduce:
1. click local folder
2. shift-click different local folder
actual results:
first folder deselected.
expected results:
kept selected.
possibly there's difference shift command-clicking (on mac).
shift click perhaps select everything clicked folder currently selected folder.
command-clicking normally selects folders explicitly click on.
possibly conventions platforms multiple selections.
multiple selections possible,

*** bug 310352 marked duplicate bug. ***
suite bug 50767.
highly-desirable opinion.
would like see implemented easier management rss subscriptions.
*** bug 366757 marked duplicate bug. ***
would love see closed, also dragging folder pane much faster.
*** bug 398712 marked duplicate bug. ***
pretty basic stuff.
bit showstopper migrating outlook users thunderbird since heavy users often tons folders organise emails.
importing mail dumps folders local folders can't re-organised inbox without going one-by-one, silly.
latest trunk multiple folders selected completely benefit it: drag drop 1 folder moved, cm shows 3 entries (open, open new tab, properties) even useless ;) (nothing happens / empty tab).

blockingâ€‘thunderbird3 ?
multiple selection either useful possible all.

blocking-tb3+ least get minimal fix in.

proposed fix
items think make sense multi select:
get messages
servers, newsgroups/feeds
open
though question item *at all*
open new tab
unsubscribe
newsgroups
delete
would useful, confirmation dialogs js, multiple delete models etc gave disabled multi selection
compact
mark folder/s read
mark newsgroup/s read
---
notes:
- hitting delete ng unsubscribe broken (confirmunsubscribe vs confirmunsubscribe)
- new saved search enabled news - create one
- moving away getselectedmsgfolders() gfoldertreeview.getselectedfolders()
still (maybe another bug...):
- fix tools menu folder commands
- drag'n'drop (disable multi?)

phil: got bandwidth this?
(from update attachment 374607 [details])
looks good me, except
&gt;+ * compacts either folders accounts given folders belong to, accounts currently selected folders.
that's hard enough parse even without stray \"either or\" ;)
(from update attachment 374607 [details])
sounds good description
going add checkin-needed keyword probably want fix nits first

-&gt;fixed
note testers: landed commands folder context menu work multiple folders, shown (and enabled).
there's lot different possible combinations folders/servers different kinds possible would good people could make sure cases work them.
