needs way open sidebar resources, history bookmarks, window.
convenient single history window take screen real estate open history whichever window i'm currently browsing.
like ctrl-b ctrl-h features mozilla would like carried over.
know bug 178199 discusses ctrl-b (wontfix perhaps ctrl-shift-b) particular i'm talking depending side bar all.
really hate sidebars would want able disable place windows would migrate firefox.
since roadmap focus standalone apps \"a conservative,sustaining engineering fashion\" type support mozilla/seamonkey, think \"seamonkey parity\" form established.
thanks.
reproducible: always
steps reproduce:
bookmark manager window already exists, bug 178199 covers giving better keyboard shortcut alt,b,m.
see bug adding history window.
something like about:history?
similar about:config - full page tree search/filter field top.
really need menu toolbar buttons like bookmarks manager.
like bm unlike sidebar, would sortable columns: name, url, last visited, first visited, number visits, etc.
would \"power-user\" supplement simple history sidebar.
sure, sidebar needs things fixed like searching urls, that, think fine uses - exactly sidebars - quick way access something without leaving/obscuring current page.
about:history page would nicely fill gap left advanced end.
whole new history window probably overkill, page could easily opened window tab.
i'm brainstorming, could probably even add search shortcut ability could type something like
about:history?extensions open history page filter pages \"extensions.\"
compare:
chrome://browser/content/history/history-panel.xul
chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarkspanel.xul
chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarksmanager.xul
about:config
reporter,
sure asking whole new history window, ability open sidebar history window.
latter case, open chrome url new window.
component fields probably need updated.
i'm really looking two things:
1. separate window keep going back window open multiple windows window.
chrome://browser/content/history/history-panel.xul would meet need.
2. able see sort history.
seamonkey offers tabs title, location, last visited, first visited, hostname, referrer, visit count.
needed least first four helpful.
plus, i'd like able open easily, /-\\h.
please add mozilla history window firefox!
think one things that's missing inferior browsers like microsoft internet explorer.
mozilla history window perfect!

agree firefox history limited best.
i'm amazed way knowing url date history entry is.
mozilla history excellent since could re-trace browsing using timestamp find collections pages visited.
history (in life browsing) useful context.
option see order page visited?
