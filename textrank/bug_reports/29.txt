identation works fine.
but:
let's see example:
hello1
hello2
hello3
go cursor hello2 press ctrl-i, hello2 moved even right.
right (and expected) behaviour hello moved left right hello1.
(compare behaviour tab xemacs)
eyes, really needs fixed.
thanks!!!
martin
oh dear, formatting lost.
imagine, hello2 moved bit right, like \\t front it.
martin
hmm, would hello2 move left?
saying align 'closest' tab boundary?
tabspace 8 characters
........hello
...........hello2
ctrl-i hello2 move left 3 away left boundary 5 away right one?
kate, ctrl-i semantics always unconditionally insert 'positive' indent.
positive meaning right.
bug wrt editors ...
hi,
hello2 moved left, aligned line above.

let try again:
let's say code
something
{
........hello1();
...........hello2();
........hello3();
}
go cursor line hello2, hello2 moved left,
1.) identation +8 spaces block, beginning opening parentheses (amount spaces depends configuration course).
2.) hello1 specifies block shall aligned.
martin
right, looking 'align' action.
'wishlist' since kate really (see below).
unconditional indent left right.
want hello2 move left go tools hit 'unindent' move left tab stop.
'indent' move position 16, next tab stop right.
alternatively try 'clean indentation' see aligns misaligned blocks code you.
even misaligned blocks code time can.

available cvs.
currently works use 'cstyle' auto-indenter.
default shortcut ctrl + tab (controlled tab) align current line block text select according normal c/c++ conventions.
see also bug 40656 information warning.
work things inside parenthesis, like parameter lists conditionals?
i'd like emacs:
( foo == 1 &&
bar == 2 ) {
doit();
}
case second condition aligned first one, according normal stuff.
parameter list handling like:
int foo(
int bar,
char *baz,
struct sizzle *gee
)
{
...
}
case closing parenthesis aligned opening one.
yes, first example works expected.
second example kinda works right now.
parameter lists aligned like expect needs reference character 'int foo (' line judge col align that.
also, closing parenthesis aligned opening one.
really problem you, open another wishlist item appropriate examples.
great, thanks lot!!
one little bug though:
. . foo();
. . bar();
cursor line foo() bar(), line tabs made yet press shortcut new align, cursor move foo().
rest works nicely!
thanks guys!
maybe re-open bug since think feature incomplete, open new bugreport this.
thanks
martin
regards foo-bar problem, intentional.
want indent empty lines would leave quite bit useless leading spaces selecting large regions hitting align -- also much slower skip lines formatting entire document.
guess could make that's case aligning _block_ text though --
i'll see do.
cannot get feature work.
working kde4 beta2?
